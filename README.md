This is my talk from EuroBSDcon 2016, Belgrade, Serbia:
"pf+rdomains create splendid multi-tenant firewalls".

Please see ERRATA.md for some after-the-conf information/findings!

Currently this repo is in preparation for AsiaBSDcon 2017.

Please see ANSIBLE.md on how to use this so far. You'll (for now)
need to use an OpenBSD/VirtualBox box that is called "obsd60" or "fix"
this in 'group_vars/all.yml'
