This is my project "pf+rdomains create splendid multi-tenant firewalls".
For reading please use the 'latest' version "asiabsdcon2017-talk.pdf" and
"asiabsdcon2017-paper.pdf".

Currently this repo is in preparation for AsiaBSDcon 2017.

Please see ANSIBLE.md on how to use this so far. You'll (for now)
need to use an OpenBSD/VirtualBox box that is called "obsd60" which
can be built with the contribution in Packer/ or change the vagrant-box-name
in 'group_vars/all.yml'
